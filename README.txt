This paint program allows free hand drawing, line drawing, circle and square drawing, various line thicknesses, custom colors, etc.  Images

This code is not documented.  It was written as the first project for my second semester java class, at which point I had only one introductory 
semseters worth of programming experience and no front end development experience.  It is included here to give an idea of what I was able to produce 
with little experience and is not representitive of my current code writing abilities.  Please consider running this program!
